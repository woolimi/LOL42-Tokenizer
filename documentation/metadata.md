## About IPFS

`IPFS` (InterPlanetary File System) is a **decentralized storage protocol** that allows for the distribution of data across a network of nodes. It uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file, ensuring that the data is immutable and securely stored. This protocol enhances the security and accessibility of data, making it an ideal solution for storing and retrieving NFT metadata and associated files.
